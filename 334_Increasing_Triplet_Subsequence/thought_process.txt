ðŸ§  Thought Process

The problem asked whether a given array contains an increasing subsequence of three numbers â€” not necessarily next to each other, but in order such that nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k] with i < j < k.

At first, I misunderstood the problem by thinking the sequence needed to be contiguous. 
My initial approach failed because I tried to find a "run" of increasing numbers rather than looking for values that could be spread out but still in the correct order.

After stepping back and asking for guidance, I got a really helpful breakdown â€” not a solution, but a way to think about it.
    Sorting the array wouldnâ€™t work, because weâ€™d lose the original indices, and the problem specifically cares about their relative positions.
    The real trick was realizing I didnâ€™t need to track every possible triplet â€” just the smallest two numbers so far (first and second) and check if a number comes along that is greater than both.
    Once that happens, we can immediately return true.

This algorithm made me realize that the best way to solve the problem is to greedily track values during a single pass through the array. 
This approach gave me an efficient O(n) time solution with O(1) space.

My Solution (Runtime: 3 ms):
    I used two variables first and second to hold candidates for the first and second elements in the potential triplet. 
    As I looped through the array:
        I kept updating first if I saw a new low.
        I updated second if I found a number between first and what second was before.
        As soon as I found a number greater than both first and second, I knew a triplet existed and returned true.


I really wanted to solve this on my own, but sometimes a little guidance goes a long way. 
Instead of asking for the full answer, I used AI as a thinking partner. The AI helped me:
    Understand what the question was really asking.
        Catch flaws in my initial logic (e.g., sorting doesn't preserve index order).
        Encourage me to think in terms of "state tracking" instead of brute-force.
        Guide me toward an efficient way of solving the problem with minimal hints.

It didnâ€™t give me the code â€” it gave me the right mental framework, and I did the rest.

Even though it took longer than expected, Iâ€™m proud I stayed committed to learning instead of rushing. 
This problem strengthened my ability to:
    Think beyond surface-level patterns (like contiguous sequences).
    Use greedy algorithms in a smart way.
    Trust the process, even if I need help along the way.
