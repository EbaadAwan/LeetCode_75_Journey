🧠 Thought Process

I started by making sure the two strings were even worth comparing. 
If their lengths don’t match, there’s no way to transform one into the other, so I returned early in that case. 
That simple check saved me time and let me focus on the real logic only when it mattered.

Next, I counted how many times each character appears in both strings. 
I used two hash maps: one for word1 and one for word2. 
For every character, I either added it to the map or bumped its count. 
This gave me a clear picture of each string: which characters it uses and how many times each one shows up.

If the two maps were exactly the same, I was done—return true. 
That means both strings already match character-for-character and count-for-count, so no operations are needed.

When the maps weren’t identical, I thought about what “close” really means for this problem. 
The allowed operations let you swap characters around freely and also swap the “labels” of characters (like turning all ‘a’s into ‘b’s and all ‘b’s into ‘a’s). 
From that, I realized two things must be true for the strings to be close: they must use the exact same set of characters (you can’t invent or delete a brand-new letter), and the multiset of frequencies must match (even if the counts are assigned to different letters, the collection of counts has to be the same).

So I pulled out two pieces of information from the maps:
    the set of unique characters, and the list of frequency counts.
    I sorted both the character sets and the frequency lists, then compared them. 
    If both the sorted character sets match and the sorted frequency lists match, the strings are close; otherwise, they’re not. 
    This captures the idea that you’re allowed to relabel characters, but not change which characters exist or how many total letters land in each “bucket” of counts.
 
I got it within the second try, which told me the mental model was right. 
The runtime was 172 ms on that version. After a cleanup—mostly small adjustments to how I built and compared those structures—I got it down to 104 ms. 
That’s still a big number compared to some blazing-fast submissions, but I’m happy with it because I understood what I wrote and why it works. 
I also know that chasing the absolute fastest result usually takes extra micro-optimizations or a different data layout, and I wasn’t going to jump to that instantly.

What I like about this solution is the clarity: check length, build counts, short-circuit if maps match, then do a clean two-part comparison (same characters, same frequency multiset). 
It’s simple, readable, and aligns perfectly with the problem’s operations. If I were to push further next time, I’d think about cutting a few allocations or using arrays when the character set is known to be lowercase English letters, but that’s a polish step, not a logic change.

Overall, this was a solid win: quick understanding, a correct approach based on the problem’s rules, and a nice runtime improvement after cleaning things up.
