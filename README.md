### ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

Welcome to my LeetCode journey!

In this repository, Iâ€™m working through the **LeetCode 75** problem sets, trying my best to solve **one problem a day** ðŸ§ ðŸ’». My goal is to stay consistent, improve my coding skills, and grow as a developer ðŸš€.

For each problem, I include:
- âœ… My **solution code**
- ðŸ§© A breakdown of my **thought process**

This repo is both a personal learning project and a **public portfolio** â€” a way to **track my progress**, stay accountable, and hopefully impress a few recruiters along the way ðŸ˜‰.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore and follow along ðŸ’¡âœ¨
