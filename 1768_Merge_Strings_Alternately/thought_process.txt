ðŸ§  Thought Process

The goal of this problem is to merge two strings by alternating characters, starting with the first character of word1.

To do this, I used two pointers â€” i for word1 and j for word2 â€” and a StringBuilder to efficiently build the final merged string.

I handled three scenarios based on the lengths of the input strings:

1. Equal lengths:
A single while loop runs as long as both pointers are within bounds. In each iteration, I append one character from word1 and then one from word2, moving both pointers forward.

2. word1 is shorter:
The first while loop alternates characters from both strings until word1 ends.
A second while loop then appends the remaining characters from word2.

3. word2 is shorter:
Similar logic applies here. The first loop alternates characters until word2 ends.
Then another loop appends the leftover characters from word1.

At first, I overcomplicated the approach, but once I broke it down into these simple steps using separate while loops, it became a clean and easy-to-understand solution.
