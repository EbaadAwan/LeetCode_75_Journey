ðŸ§  Thought Process

To solve this problem, I needed to find the greatest common "divisor" string that can be used to construct both input strings `str1` and `str2` through repeated concatenation. 
In other words, I had to identify the largest possible string that could be multiplied (i.e., repeated) some number of times to recreate both `str1` and `str2`.

My first step was to observe a key mathematical property: if both strings can be constructed by repeating the same substring, then the length of that substring must divide evenly into the lengths of both strings. 
This led me to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the lengths of `str1` and `str2` using the Euclidean Algorithm. 
That value would represent the maximum length for any potential common divisor string.

Once I had the GCD of the lengths, I approached the problem using a hands-on method. 
I used a loop to shrink `str2` from the end one character at a time, treating each shortened version as a candidate substring. 
For each candidate, I tried to build `str1` by repeatedly appending that candidate until the lengths matched. 
If the result matched `str1`, I did the same for the original value of `str2` to ensure that both strings could be built from this substring.

If both checks passed, I returned the substring as the answer. 
If not, I kept shrinking `str2` and trying again until there were no more characters left to test.

This method worked and passed all the test cases, but it was not very efficient. 
My solution ran in 13 milliseconds, which was slower compared to optimized solutions. 
However, I was happy that I was able to think through the logic and arrive at a working solution on my own, even if it wasnâ€™t the cleanest.

After completing the problem and reviewing other approaches, I realized that the code could have been simplified significantly. 
A cleaner and faster way is to first check if `str1 + str2` equals `str2 + str1`. 
If this condition is not met, it means no common base string can form both inputs. 
If the condition is true, then the greatest common divisor of the lengths of the two strings gives the correct length for the answer. 
In that case, the result would simply be `str1.substring(0, gcd)`.

This alternate method avoids the repeated string building and shrinking, and results in a much more efficient solution. 
Looking back, I would improve my code by incorporating this logic to make it cleaner and more performant.

Overall, solving this problem helped me understand how mathematical concepts like GCD can be applied to string patterns, and it gave me practice in both string manipulation and optimization.
